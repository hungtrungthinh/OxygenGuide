# OxygenGuide

OxygenGuide is an offline world travel guide, based on the online travel guide [Wikivoyage](http://en.wikivoyage.org).

Unlike Wikivoyage, you can use OxygenGuide even when offline: in the place, in the mountains, in the countryside.
It also loads pages faster than via the Internet, and can save you a lot of roaming fees.

An alternative can be to use [Kiwix](http://www.kiwix.org/wiki/Wikivoyage)
